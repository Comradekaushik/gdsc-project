He is the grand mastermind behind World War 3 and the cause of the entire series' events, always pulling the strings from behind the lines as the puppet master.

Taking the zero-sum game to heart, he did whatever was necessary to gain the upper hand without any regard to the loss of human life in the process, even shooting Yuri (his only known friend) to reach his objective.

                The group has claimed responsibility for several attacks conducted over the Internet since 2009, most notably attacks against Baidu and Twitter.The attack against Baidu resulted in the so-called Sino-Iranian Hacker War. In 2012, a group self-identified as "Parastoo" (Persian: پرستو - Swallow) hacked the International Atomic Energy Agency's servers: the Iranian Cyber Army is suspected of being behind the attack.
                In 2013, a general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards stated that Iran had "the 4th biggest cyber power among the world's cyber armies", a claim supported by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies.

                Unlocking Creativity and Collaboration: The Joys of a Coding Club
                <br>
                In the bustling hub of a coding club, where keyboards click and screens glow, magic happens. Young minds gather, fueled by curiosity and a shared passion for code. Here are some of the enchanting benefits they discover:

                1. Community and Camaraderie:
                - A coding club isn't just about syntax and algorithms; it's about forging connections. Members swap ideas, debug together, and celebrate victories. It's a place where geeks become friends and introverts find their tribe.
                <br>
                2. Skill Sharpening:
                - Like a whetstone for skills, coding clubs hone abilities. Whether it's mastering a new language, diving into web development, or conquering data structures, members learn by doing. They tackle real-world problems, their code blossoming into elegant solutions.
                <br>
                3. Creativity Unleashed:
                - Code isn't just logic; it's art. In the club, minds collide, sparking creativity. They build apps that simplify lives, websites that dazzle, and games that transport players to other realms. The canvas? A blank screen. The palette? Lines of code.
                <br>
                4. Hackathons and Challenges:
                - The adrenaline rush of a hackathon—the sleepless nights, the caffeine-fueled brainstorming, the race against the clock—fuels innovation. Coding clubs thrive on these challenges, pushing boundaries and turning caffeine into code.
                <br>
                5. Career Launchpad:
                - Coding clubs aren't just about fun; they're stepping stones. Members gain practical experience, network with industry professionals, and discover internships. The club becomes a launchpad for tech careers, propelling them toward the stars.
